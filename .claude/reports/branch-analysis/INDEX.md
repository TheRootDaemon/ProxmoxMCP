# Branch Analysis History

## Recent Analyses
- **[2025-06-17 20:29]** Comprehensive branch analysis - 6 branches, 1 clean feature, 5 problematic branches requiring cleanup
  - **Critical finding:** Multiple branches with massive file deletions and scope creep
  - **Immediate action:** Merge `feature/mcp-claude-sdk-integration`, cherry-pick MyPy fixes, cleanup problematic branches
  - **Report:** [branch-analysis-20250617-202920.md](./branch-analysis-20250617-202920.md)

## Analysis Trends
- **Average branches per analysis:** 6
- **Most common issues:** Scope creep, massive file deletions, branch purpose misalignment
- **Clean branches identified:** 1 (feature/mcp-claude-sdk-integration)
- **Problematic branches:** 5 requiring cleanup/selective extraction

## Key Patterns Identified
1. **Feature branches with legitimate scope:** `feature/mcp-claude-sdk-integration` (+1517/-67 lines, focused on MCP integration)
2. **Problematic patterns:** Massive file deletions (100+ files) in multiple branches
3. **Scope creep:** Issue-specific branches becoming project-wide refactoring efforts
4. **Stale branches:** Multiple branches with 0 commits vs main, 15+ days old

## Recommendations Implemented
- Branch hygiene guidelines needed in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Pre-merge quality gates for scope verification
- Immediate cleanup actions for 5 problematic branches

## Next Analysis Scheduled
- **Date:** 2025-06-24 (weekly cadence recommended)
- **Focus:** Post-cleanup verification and new branch assessment
- **Automation opportunity:** Consider automated branch scope analysis
