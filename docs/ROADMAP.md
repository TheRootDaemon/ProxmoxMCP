# ProxmoxMCP Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development and improvement efforts for the ProxmoxMCP project, based on the comprehensive repository review. The roadmap is organized by priority to help guide development efforts and community contributions.

## Critical Priorities (Immediate Focus)

These items address critical security vulnerabilities and error handling issues that should be addressed as soon as possible:

### Security Improvements

- [ ] **Token Encryption**: Implement token encryption at rest in `src/proxmox_mcp/config/loader.py`
- [ ] **SSL Verification**: Enable SSL verification by default in configuration examples
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Add input validation for VM commands in `src/proxmox_mcp/tools/vm.py`
- [ ] **Docker Secrets**: Implement Docker secrets for sensitive credentials in `compose.yaml`

### Error Handling Enhancements

- [ ] **Standardize Error Handling**: Create consistent error handling patterns across the codebase
- [ ] **Specific Exceptions**: Replace generic exception catching with specific exception types
- [ ] **Configuration Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling for configuration loading
- [ ] **Error Propagation**: Implement proper error propagation to clients

## High Priority (Next Development Cycle)

These items should be addressed in the next development cycle after critical issues are resolved:

### Docker Configuration Improvements

- [ ] **Resource Limits**: Add resource limits in `compose.yaml`
- [ ] **Read-Only Filesystem**: Implement read-only filesystem where possible
- [ ] **Base Image Versioning**: Use specific version tags for base images in `Dockerfile`
- [ ] **Health Checks**: Add health checks for container monitoring

### Scalability Enhancements

- [ ] **Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling in `src/proxmox_mcp/core/proxmox.py`
- [ ] **Data Caching**: Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] **Async Operations**: Convert more operations to async, particularly in `src/proxmox_mcp/tools/`
- [ ] **Request Throttling**: Implement request throttling to prevent API rate limiting

### Documentation Improvements

- [ ] **Quick Start Guide**: Add a comprehensive quick start guide
- [ ] **Troubleshooting FAQ**: Create a troubleshooting FAQ
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Standardize environment variable names and document them
- [ ] **Docker Deployment**: Improve Docker deployment documentation
- [ ] **Security Best Practices**: Add security best practices section

## Medium Priority (Future Development)

These items should be addressed after high-priority items are completed:

### Extensibility Improvements

- [ ] **Plugin System**: Implement a formal plugin system
- [ ] **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Add dynamic tool discovery
- [ ] **Extension Documentation**: Create better documentation for extending the tool set
- [ ] **Configuration Validation**: Implement configuration schema validation

### Code Quality Enhancements

- [ ] **Logging Consistency**: Make logging practices consistent across the codebase
- [ ] **Type Annotations**: Add comprehensive type annotations
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup**: Implement proper resource cleanup in all tools
- [ ] **Code Refactoring**: Refactor complex modules for better maintainability

### Testing Improvements

- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Expand test coverage beyond the current limited tests
- [ ] **Security Testing**: Add security-focused tests
- [ ] **Container Testing**: Implement container testing
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Add integration tests with a mock Proxmox API

## Future Enhancements (Long-term Vision)

These items represent the long-term vision for the project:

### Feature Additions

- [ ] **LXC Container Support**: Add support for LXC containers
- [ ] **Batch Operations**: Implement batch operations for better performance
- [ ] **Proxmox Backup Server**: Add support for Proxmox Backup Server
- [ ] **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement resource monitoring and alerting

### Integration Improvements

- [ ] **Cline Integration**: Enhance Cline integration examples
- [ ] **MCP Client Support**: Add support for other MCP clients
- [ ] **API Versioning**: Implement API versioning
- [ ] **Monitoring Integration**: Add integration with monitoring systems
- [ ] **Webhook Support**: Implement webhook support for events

## Timeline

- **Q2 2025**: Address all Critical priority items
- **Q3 2025**: Complete High priority items
- **Q4 2025**: Address Medium priority items
- **2026**: Begin work on Future enhancements

This roadmap is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves and new priorities emerge.
