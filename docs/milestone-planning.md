## Milestone Management Guidelines

### What Milestones Should Represent

**Milestones should be:**

- **Release-focused**: Tied to specific software releases (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)
- **Time-bound**: Have clear due dates
- **Goal-oriented**: Represent meaningful project achievements
- **User-facing**: Deliver value to end users

**Examples for ProxmoxMCP:**

- `v1.0.0 - Stable Release`
- `v1.1.0 - Enhanced Security`
- `v2.0.0 - Breaking Changes`
- `Q3 2025 - Performance Improvements`

### Milestone Planning Best Practices

#### 1. Use Semantic Versioning

```
v1.0.0 - Major release
v1.1.0 - Minor features  
v1.0.1 - Bug fixes
```

#### 2. Set Realistic Due Dates

- Based on team capacity and complexity
- Allow buffer time for testing and documentation
- Review and adjust dates as needed

#### 3. Scope Appropriately

- **Small milestones** (2-4 weeks): 5-15 issues
- **Medium milestones** (1-2 months): 15-30 issues
- **Large milestones** (quarterly): 30+ issues

#### 4. Balance Issue Types

```
Typical milestone composition:
- 60% Features/Enhancements
- 25% Bug fixes
- 10% Documentation
- 5% Technical debt
```
